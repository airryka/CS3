			<h1>Fearless (Taylor's Version)</h1>
			<hr>
				<li>An amazing album with a lot of songs written by the one and only Taylor Swift.</li>
				<li>My Favorite song from this album is Forevr and Always (Taylor's Version)</li>
				<li>Fearless (Taylor’s Version) is the first of Taylor Swift’s rerecorded albums, which she created to regain ownership of the six albums she created under Big Machine Records. It includes a new version of every song on Fearless Platinum Edition, along with standalone single “Today Was a Fairytale” and six songs she cut from the original 2008 Fearless album.</li>
