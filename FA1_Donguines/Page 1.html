			<h1>Folklore</h1>
			<hr>
				<li>One of the best Quarantine album to be honest</li>
				<li>Taylor and her co-writers really did a great job in writing an album with a lot of emotions with catchy rhythm </li>
				<li>The title was inspired by the singer's desire for the music to have a lasting legacy akin to folk songs, whereas its artwork and aesthetic reflect cottagecore. Upon release, Folklore broke the Guinness World Record for the biggest opening day on Spotify for an album by a female act.</li>
