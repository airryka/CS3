				The 1975 are an English pop rock band formed in 2002 in Wilmslow, Cheshire. Now based in Manchester, the band consists of lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist Matthew "Matty" Healy, lead guitarist Adam Hann, bassist Ross MacDonald, and drummer George Daniel.

The band members met in secondary school and performed together as teenagers. Gigs, organised by a council worker, led the band to sign with Dirty Hit and Polydor Records. They opened for several major acts and released a series of extended plays (Facedown, Sex, Music for Cars, IV) from 2012â€“13, before releasing their UK chart-topping self-titled debut album (2013), which includes the popular singles "Sex", "Chocolate", and "Robbers".
